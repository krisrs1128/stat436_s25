```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(ceramic)
library(knitr)
library(sf)
library(spData)
library(tidyverse)
library(tmap)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

1. As mentioned previously, vector data are used to store geometric spatial
data. Specifically, there are 7 types of geometric information that are commonly
used, as given in the figure below.

```{r}
include_graphics("https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat479/posts/2021-03-02-week7-2/sf-classes.png")
```

3. We can construct these geometric objects from scratch. For example, starting
from the defining coordinates, we can use `st_point` to create a point object,

```{r}
# make a point
p <- st_point(c(5, 2))
plot(p)
```

`st_linestring` to create a linestring, 

```{r}
# make a line
linestring_matrix <- rbind(c(1, 5), c(4, 4), c(4, 1), c(2, 2), c(3, 2))
p <- st_linestring(linestring_matrix)
plot(p)
```

and `st_polygon` to create a polygon.

```{r}
# make a polygon
polygon_list <- list(rbind(c(1, 5), c(2, 2), c(4, 1), c(4, 4), c(1, 5)))
p <- st_polygon(polygon_list)
plot(p)
```

4. Different geometries can be combined into a geometry collection, using `sfc`.

```{r}
point1 <- st_point(c(5, 2))
point2 <- st_point(c(1, 3))
points_sfc <- st_sfc(point1, point2)
plot(points_sfc)
```

5. Real-world vector datasets are more than just these geometries â€” they also
associate each geometry with some additional information about each feature. We
can add this information to the geometries above by associating each element
with a row of a data.frame. This merging is accomplished by `st_sf`, using
`geometry` to associate a raw `st_geom` each row of a data.frame.

```{r}
lnd_point <- st_point(c(0.1, 51.5))                
lnd_geom <- st_sfc(lnd_point, crs = 4326)         
lnd_attrib = data.frame(                        
  name = "London",
  temperature = 25,
  date = as.Date("2017-06-21")
  )

lnd_sf = st_sf(lnd_attrib, geometry = lnd_geom)
```

### Visualization

5. Vector data can be directly plotted using base R. For example, suppose we
want to plot the boundaries of India, within it's local context. We can use the
`world` dataset, provided by the `spData` package. Each row of the `world`
object contains both the boundary of a country (in the `geom` column) and
information about its location and population characteristics.

```{r}
data(world)
head(world)
```

This makes the plot, using `dplyr` to filter down to just the row containing the
India geometry.

```{r}
india_geom <- world %>%
  filter(name_long == "India") %>%
  st_geometry()

plot(india_geom)
```

6. Using base R, we can also layer on several vector objects, using `add = TRUE`.

```{r}
world_asia <- world %>%
  filter(continent == "Asia")

plot(india_geom, expandBB = c(0, 0.2, 0.1, 1), col = "gray", lwd = 3)
plot(st_union(world_asia), add = TRUE)
```

7. We can also use `tm_polygons` in tmap. To change the coordinates of the
viewing box, we can set the `bbox` (bounding box) argument.

```{r}
bbox <- c(60, 5, 110, 40)
tm_shape(world_asia, bbox = bbox) +
  tm_polygons(col = "white") +
  tm_shape(india_geom) +
  tm_polygons()
```

8. We can also encode data that's contained in the vector dataset.

```{r}
tm_shape(world_asia, bbox = bbox) +
  tm_polygons(col = "lifeExp") +
  tm_polygons()
```

9. Even in this more complex setup, where we work with background images and
vector data rather than standard data.frames, we can still apply the kinds of
visual encoding ideas that we are familiar with. For example, we can still color
code or facet by fields in the vector dataset. To illustrate, we revisit the bus
route data from the last lecture and distinguish between buses operated by the
cities of Madison vs. Monona. Before plotting, we fetch the underlying data.

```{r}
Sys.setenv(MAPBOX_API_KEY="pk.eyJ1Ijoia3Jpc3JzMTEyOCIsImEiOiJjbDYzdjJzczQya3JzM2Jtb2E0NWU1a3B3In0.Mk4-pmKi_klg3EKfTw-JbQ")
basemap <- cc_location(loc= c(-89.401230, 43.073051), buffer = 15e3)
bus <- read_sf("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/5neu1mpuh8esmb1q3j9celu73jy1rj2i.geojson")

tm_shape(basemap) +
  tm_rgb() +
  tm_shape(bus) +
  tm_lines(col = "#bc7ab3", size = 1)
```

Note that `operator` is the field containing information about which city is
operating the buses. We can color code the routes by this attribute.

```{r}
tm_shape(basemap) +
  tm_rgb() +
  tm_shape(bus) +
  tm_lines(col = "operator", size = 1) +
  tm_layout(legend.bg.color = "white")
```

Alternatively, we can facet.

```{r}
tm_shape(basemap) +
  tm_rgb() +
  tm_shape(bus) +
  tm_lines(col = "operator", size = 1) +
  tm_facets("operator")
```
