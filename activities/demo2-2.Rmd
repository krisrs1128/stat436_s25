```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
my_theme <- theme_bw() +
  theme(
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),

[Olympics Derivations] This problem gives some practice with deriving and visualizing new variables.

```{r}
olympics <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/rzw8h2x6dp5693gdbpgxaf2koqijo12l.csv")
olympics
```

a. Create new columns for the city and country of birth for each athlete in the
London 2012 Olympics
[dataset](https://uwmadison.box.com/s/rzw8h2x6dp5693gdbpgxaf2koqijo12l).

```{r}
olympics |>
  mutate(birth_city = str_split(`Place of birth`, "\\(")) |>
  unnest_wider(birth_city, "_") |>
  select(-birth_city_2) |>
  rename(birth_city = birth_city_1) |>
  select(Name, birth_city, Country)
```

Rows 81 - 90 seem to have some mistakes...

b. Compute the standard deviation of athlete age within each sport. Which sport
has widest SD in age?

```{r}
olympics |>
  group_by(Sport) |>
  summarise(age_sd = sd(Age)) |>
  arrange(-age_sd)
```

c. Make a visualization of sports against participant age. Sort sports by
age variance.

```{r}
counts <- olympics |>
  count(Sport)

olympics |>
  left_join(counts) |>
  filter(n > 5) |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(
    aes(Age, reorder(Sport, Age, sd))
  )
```
