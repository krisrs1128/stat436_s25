[Histopathology Embeddings] This problem investigates the features learned by
a residual network model trained trained to classify histopathology slides.
Specifically, the script at [this
link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bPFz718F-YE0iUcdkm2kc0Aeg8g6-Neh?usp=sharing)
was used to train a model to images from the Pcam [benchmark
dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data).
Each image is a tissue slide. The class labels describe whether the center $32 \times 32$ patch within the image contains any cancerous cells.

In the process, we will also practice using the `reticulate` package to read in
numpy arrays produced by the python training script linked above. This language
interoperability makes it possible to use the packages best suited to both
modeling (`pytorch`) and visualization (`ggplot2`).

a. We have hosted a subsample of the training images at [this
link](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat436_s24/raw/main/data/subset.tar.gz).
Their corresponding [labels](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat436_s24/raw/main/data/y.npy) and [file names](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat436_s24/raw/main/data/fnames.npy) are stored as numpy arrays. Visualize the raw images corresponding to 10 images from each class. _Hint: To unzip these files from the command line, you can use `tar -zxvf subset.tar.gz`_  

```{r}
library(reticulate)
#py_install("numpy") # make sure to install numpy
repl_python()
```

```{python}
import numpy as np
fnames = np.load("fnames.npy")
y = np.load("y.npy")
```

```{r}
library(fs)
library(raster)
library(reticulate)
library(tmap)

# download the subset.tar.gz and unzip
data_dir <- path("/Users/ksankaran/Downloads/subset/")
ix <- which(py$y == 1)[1:10]
```

```{r}
ix <- which(py$y == 0)[1:10]
```

b. For the subsample in part (a), we have saved the residual network
features from the final pre-classification layer. They are available
at [this
link](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat436_s24/raw/main/data/h.npy).
Generate UMAP embeddings for the images based on these features, and shade
in each sample according to its class.

```{python}
h = np.load("h.npy")
```

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(embed)
```

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
```

c. Using `geom_image` from `ggimage`, display the original images from (a) at
the locations of the UMAP coordinates from (b). The correspondence between image
filenames and features is given by [this array](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat479_s22/blob/main/_slides/week13/exercises/fnames.npy?raw=true).
In particular, the $i^{th}$ element of this array is the source image for the
$i^{th}$ row of the features matrix.

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
library(ggimage)
```
