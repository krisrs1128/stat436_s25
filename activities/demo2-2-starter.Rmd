[Olympics Derivations] This problem gives some practice with deriving and visualizing new variables.

```{r}
olympics <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/rzw8h2x6dp5693gdbpgxaf2koqijo12l.csv")
olympics
```

a. Create new columns for the city and country of birth for each athlete in the
London 2012 Olympics
[dataset](https://uwmadison.box.com/s/rzw8h2x6dp5693gdbpgxaf2koqijo12l).

b. Compute the standard deviation of athlete age within each sport. Which sport
has widest SD in age?

c. Make a visualization of sports against participant age. Sort sports by
age variance.
