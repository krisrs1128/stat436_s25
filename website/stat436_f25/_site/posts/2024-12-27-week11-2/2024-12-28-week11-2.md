1.  There are several packages in R that can be used to fit topic
    models. We will use LDA as implemented in the `topicmodels` package,
    which expects input to be structured as a `DocumentTermMatrix`, a
    special type of matrix that stores the counts of words (columns)
    across documents (rows). In practice, most of the effort required to
    fit a topic model goes into transforming the raw data into a
    suitable `DocumentTermMatrix`.

2.  To illustrate this process, let’s consider the “Great Library Heist”
    example from the reading. We imagine that a thief has taken four
    books — Great Expectations, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea,
    War of the Worlds, and Pride & Prejudice — and torn all the chapters
    out. We are left with pieces of isolated pieces of text and have to
    determine from which book they are from. The block below downloads
    all the books into an R object.

<!-- -->

    titles <- c("Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea", 
                "The War of the Worlds",
                "Pride and Prejudice", 
                "Great Expectations")
    books <- gutenberg_works(title %in% titles) %>%
      gutenberg_download(meta_fields = "title")
    books

    ## # A tibble: 53,724 × 3
    ##    gutenberg_id text                    title                
    ##           <int> <chr>                   <chr>                
    ##  1           36 "cover "                The War of the Worlds
    ##  2           36 ""                      The War of the Worlds
    ##  3           36 ""                      The War of the Worlds
    ##  4           36 ""                      The War of the Worlds
    ##  5           36 ""                      The War of the Worlds
    ##  6           36 "The War of the Worlds" The War of the Worlds
    ##  7           36 ""                      The War of the Worlds
    ##  8           36 "by H. G. Wells"        The War of the Worlds
    ##  9           36 ""                      The War of the Worlds
    ## 10           36 ""                      The War of the Worlds
    ## # … with 53,714 more rows

1.  Since we imagine that the word distributions are not equal across
    the books, topic modeling is a reasonable approach for discovering
    the books associated with each chapter. Note that, in principle,
    other clustering and dimensionality reduction procedures could also
    work.

2.  First, let’s simulate the process of tearing the chapters out. We
    split the raw texts anytime the word “Chapter” appears. We will keep
    track of the book names for each chapter, but this information is
    not passed into the topic modeling algorithm.

<!-- -->

    by_chapter <- books %>%
      group_by(title) %>%
      mutate(
        chapter = cumsum(str_detect(text, regex("chapter", ignore_case = TRUE)))
      ) %>%
      group_by(title, chapter) %>%
      mutate(n = n()) %>%
      filter(n > 5) %>%
      ungroup() %>%
      unite(document, title, chapter)

1.  As it is, the text data are long character strings, giving actual
    text from the novels. To fit LDA, we only need counts of each word
    within each chapter – the algorithm throws away information related
    to word order. To derive word counts, we first split the raw text
    into separate words using the `unest_tokens` function in the
    tidytext package. Then, we can count the number of times each word
    appeared in each document using `count`, a shortcut for the usual
    `group_by` and `summarize(n = n())` pattern.

<!-- -->

    word_counts <- by_chapter %>%
      unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
      anti_join(stop_words) %>%
      count(document, word) # shortcut for group_by(document, word) %>% summarise(n = n())

    word_counts

    ## # A tibble: 101,279 × 3
    ##    document               word             n
    ##    <chr>                  <chr>        <int>
    ##  1 Great Expectations_0   1867             1
    ##  2 Great Expectations_0   charles          1
    ##  3 Great Expectations_0   contents         1
    ##  4 Great Expectations_0   dickens          1
    ##  5 Great Expectations_0   edition          1
    ##  6 Great Expectations_0   expectations     1
    ##  7 Great Expectations_0   illustration     1
    ##  8 Great Expectations_100 age              1
    ##  9 Great Expectations_100 arose            1
    ## 10 Great Expectations_100 barnard’s        1
    ## # … with 101,269 more rows

1.  These words counts are still not in a format compatible with
    conversion to a `DocumentTermMatrix`. The issue is that the
    `DocumentTermMatrix` expects words to be arranged along columns, but
    currently they are stored across rows. The line below converts the
    original “long” word counts into a “wide” `DocumentTermMatrix` in
    one step. Across these 4 books, we have 65 chapters and a vocabulary
    of size 18325.

<!-- -->

    chapters_dtm <- word_counts %>%
      cast_dtm(document, word, n)
    chapters_dtm

    ## <<DocumentTermMatrix (documents: 195, terms: 18744)>>
    ## Non-/sparse entries: 101279/3553801
    ## Sparsity           : 97%
    ## Maximal term length: 19
    ## Weighting          : term frequency (tf)

1.  Once the data are in this format, we can use the `LDA` function to
    fit a topic model. We choose *K* = 4 topics because we expect that
    each topic will match a book. Different hyperparameters can be set
    using the `control` argument.

<!-- -->

    chapters_lda <- LDA(chapters_dtm, k = 4, control = list(seed = 1234))
    chapters_lda

    ## A LDA_VEM topic model with 4 topics.

1.  There are two types of outputs produced by the LDA model: the topic
    word distributions (for each topic, which words are common?) and the
    document-topic memberships (from which topics does a document come
    from?). For visualization, it will be easiest to extract these
    parameters using the `tidy` function, specifying whether we want the
    topics (beta) or memberships (gamma).

<!-- -->

    topics <- tidy(chapters_lda, matrix = "beta")
    memberships <- tidy(chapters_lda, matrix = "gamma")

1.  This tidy approach is preferable to extracting the parameters
    directly from the fitted model (e.g., using `chapters_lda@gamma`)
    because it ensures the output is a tidy data.frame, rather than a
    matrix. Tidy data.frames are easier to visualize using ggplot2.
