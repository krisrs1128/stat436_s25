1.  Clustering algorithms usually require the number of clusters *K* as
    an argument. How should it be chosen?

2.  There are many possible criteria, but one common approach is to
    compute the silhouette statistic. It is a statistic that can be
    computed for each observation in a dataset, measuring how strongly
    it is tied to its assigned cluster. If a whole cluster has large
    silhouette statistics, then that cluster is well-defined and clearly
    isolated other clusters.

3.  The plots below illustrate the computation of silhouette statistics
    for a clustering of the penguins dataset that used *K* = 3. To set
    up, we first need to cluster the penguins dataset. The idea is the
    same as in the *K*-means notes, but we encapsulate the code in a
    function, so that we can easily extract data for different values of
    *K*.

<!-- -->

    penguins <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ijh7iipc9ect1jf0z8qa2n3j7dgem1gh.csv") %>%
      na.omit() %>%
      mutate(id = row_number())

    cluster_penguins <- function(penguins, K) {
      x <- penguins %>%
        select(matches("length|depth|mass")) %>%
        scale()
        
      kmeans(x, center = K) %>%
        augment(penguins) %>% # creates column ".cluster" with cluster label
        mutate(silhouette = silhouette(as.integer(.cluster), dist(x))[, "sil_width"])
    }

1.  Denote the silhouette statistic of observation *i* by
    *s*<sub>*i*</sub>. We will compute *s*<sub>*i*</sub> for the
    observation with the black highlight below[1].

<!-- -->

    cur_id <- 2
    penguins3 <- cluster_penguins(penguins, K = 3)
    obs_i <- penguins3 %>%
      filter(id == cur_id)

    ggplot(penguins3, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, col = .cluster)) +
      geom_point(data = obs_i, size = 5, col = "black") + 
      geom_point() +
      scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
      scale_size(range = c(4, 1))

statistic.](2022-12-27-week09-04_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

1.  The first step in the calculation of the silhouette statistic is to
    measure the pairwise distances between the observation *i* and all
    observations in the same cluster. These distances are the lengths of
    the small lines below. Call average of these lengths
    *a*<sub>*i*</sub>.

<!-- -->

    ggplot(penguins3, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, col = .cluster)) +
      geom_segment(
        data = penguins3 %>% filter(.cluster == obs_i$.cluster), 
        aes(xend = obs_i$bill_length_mm, yend = obs_i$bill_depth_mm),
        size = 0.6, alpha = 0.3
      ) +
      geom_point(data = obs_i, size = 5, col = "black") + 
      geom_point() +
      scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
      scale_size(range = c(4, 1)) +
      labs(title = expression(paste("Distances used for ", a[i])))

the same
cluster.](2022-12-27-week09-04_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

1.  Next, we compute pairwise distances to all observations in clusters
    2 and 3. The average of these pairwise distances are called
    *b*<sub>*i*2</sub> and *b*<sub>*i*3</sub>. Choose the smaller of
    *b*<sub>*i*2</sub> and *b*<sub>*i*3</sub>, and call it
    *b*<sub>*i*</sub>. In a sense, this is the “next best” cluster to
    put observation *i*. For a general *K*, you would compute
    *b*<sub>*i**k*</sub> for all *k* (other than observation *i*’s
    cluster) and take the minimum across all of them. In this case, the
    orange segments are on average smaller than the blue segments, so
    *b*<sub>*i*</sub> is defined as the average length of the orange
    segments.

<!-- -->

    ggplot(penguins3, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, col = .cluster)) +
      geom_segment(
        data = penguins3 %>% filter(.cluster != obs_i$.cluster), 
        aes(xend = obs_i$bill_length_mm, yend = obs_i$bill_depth_mm, col = .cluster),
        size = 0.5, alpha = 0.3
      ) +
      geom_point(data = obs_i, size = 5, col = "black") + 
      geom_point() +
      scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
      scale_size(range = c(4, 1)) +
      labs(title = expression(paste("Distances used for ", b[i][1], " and ", b[i][2])))

*different*
clusters.](2022-12-27-week09-04_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

1.  The silhouette statistic for observation *i* is derived from the
    relative lengths of the orange vs. green segments. Formally, the
    silhouette statistic for observation *i* is
    $s\_{i}:= \frac{b\_{i} - a\_{i}}{\max\left({a\_{i}, b\_{i}}\right)}$.
    This number is close to 1 if the orange segments are much longer
    than the green segments, close to 0 if the segments are about the
    same size, and close to -1 if the the orange segments are much
    shorter than the green segments[2].

2.  The median of these *s*<sub>*i*</sub> for all observations within
    cluster *k* is a measure of how well-defined cluster *k* is overall.
    The higher this number, the more well-defined the cluster.

3.  Denote the median of the silhouette statistics within cluster *k* by
    *S**S*<sub>*k*</sub>. A measure how good a choice of *K* is can be
    determined by the median of these medians:
    Quality(*K*) := median<sub>*k* = 1…, *K*</sub>*S**S*<sub>*k*</sub>.

4.  In particular, this can be used to define (a) a good cut point in a
    hierarchical clustering or (b) a point at which a cluster should no
    longer be split into subgroups.

5.  In R, we can use the `silhouette` function from the cluster package
    to compute the silhouette statistic. The syntax is
    `silhouette(cluster_labels, pairwise_distances)` where
    `cluster_labels` is a vector of (integer) cluster ID’s for each
    observation and `pairwise_distances` gives the lengths of the
    segments between all pairs of observations. An example of this
    function’s usage is given in the function at the start of the
    illustration.

6.  This is what the silhouette statistic looks like in the penguins
    dataset when we choose 3 clusters. The larger points have lower
    silhouette statistics. This points between clusters 2 and 3 have
    large silhouette statistics because those two clusters blend into
    one another.

      geom_point(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, col = .cluster, size = silhouette)) +
      scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
      scale_size(range = c(4, 1))

*K*-means with
*K* = 3.](2022-12-27-week09-04_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

1.  We can also visualize the histogram of silhouette statistics within
    each cluster. Since the silhouette statistics for cluster 2 are
    generally lower than those for the other two clusters (in
    particular, its median is lower), we can conclude that it is less
    well-defined.

<!-- -->

    ggplot(penguins3) +
      geom_histogram(aes(x = silhouette), binwidth = 0.05) +
      facet_grid(~ .cluster)

well-defined each cluster
is.](2022-12-27-week09-04_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

1.  If we choose even more clusters, then there are more points lying
    along the boundaries of poorly defined clusters. Their associated
    silhouette statistics end up becoming larger. From the histogram, we
    can also see a deterioration in the median silhouette scores across
    all clusters.

    penguins4 <- cluster_penguins(penguins, K = 4)
    ggplot(penguins4) +
      geom_point(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, col = .cluster, size = silhouette)) +
      scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
      scale_size(range = c(4, 1))

[1] You can change `cur_id` to try different observations.

[2] This last case likely indicates a misclustering.
